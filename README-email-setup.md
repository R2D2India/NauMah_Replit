# NauMah Email Setup Guide

## Email Delivery Issue Resolution

We identified that the email delivery issue is related to SendGrid's sender verification requirements. Here's how to fix it:

### Option 1: Verify a Sender in SendGrid (Recommended for Production)

1. **Verify Your Domain or Email Address**:
   - Log into your SendGrid account
   - Go to Settings > Sender Authentication
   - Follow the verification process for either a domain or single sender
   - This typically involves adding DNS records or clicking a verification link

2. **Update the Code**:
   - Once verified, update the `SENDGRID_VERIFIED_SENDER` variable in `server/email.ts` with your verified email address
   - The application has been modified to properly use this verified sender

### Option 2: Use a Testing Email Service (For Development)

For development and testing purposes, you might consider alternatives that don't require sender verification:

1. **Mailtrap**: Creates a safe testing environment for email
   - Sign up at [mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io)
   - Get SMTP credentials and update the application to use Mailtrap instead

2. **Ethereal Email**: A fake SMTP service by Nodemailer team
   - No account needed - it generates disposable accounts
   - Emails are captured for viewing but never delivered to real inboxes

### Option 3: Use an SMTP Relay Service with Domain Verification

If you're using a custom domain like `naumah.com` for emails:

1. **Amazon SES**:
   - Verify your domain with AWS SES
   - Update the application to use AWS SES Node.js SDK

2. **Mailgun**:
   - Offers a generous free tier
   - Has simpler domain verification process than SendGrid in some cases

## Debug Email Issues

For ongoing email troubleshooting:

1. Check the server logs for detailed SendGrid errors
2. Verify that email tracking data is being stored correctly
3. Ensure that the SENDGRID_API_KEY has sufficient permissions
4. Check for rate-limiting or account suspension issues in your SendGrid dashboard

The code has been updated to add extensive logging around email sending, which will help diagnose any future issues.
